# Features to implement:

The user will be able to configure a key to use as it's main way to deposit straight to its account.

What I essentially want is to build a app that allows the user to create an infinite amount of cards and let other users interact with the virtual cards.

The virtual cards will have configurable limits and can be blocked at any time.

When money is paid to a virtual card can have automation that will trigger when money is received/transfered.

Or when a card has less money the the minimum a and it has a piggy bank vinculate to it, the money should be taken out and deposited to the card
